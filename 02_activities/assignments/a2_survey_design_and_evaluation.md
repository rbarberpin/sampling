# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

Sampling Design

Target population: All University of Toronto students and alumni aged 18‚Äì70.

Sampling frame: U of T email lists (students) and alumni directory.

Sampling units: Individuals selected via stratified random sampling by age group (18‚Äì25, 26‚Äì40, 41‚Äì55, 56‚Äì70).

Observational units: Survey respondents.

Strategy: Stratified random sample to secure adequate representation across age groups. Invitation emails with survey links; reminders sent twice.

Your 5-10 question survey:

1. What is your current age? (closed selection numeric)

2. Which music genres do you regularly listen to? (Select all that apply: Pop, Rock, Classical, Jazz, Hip‚ÄëHop, EDM, Country, Folk, Other [specify])

3. Name the top three artists or bands you listen to most often. (Open text)

4. How many hours per week do you spend listening to music? (Numeric)

5. How do you mainly access music? (Streaming services, Radio, Vinyl/CD, Live concerts, Other)

6. Do you feel your music taste has changed since age 15? (Yes/No)

8. How much does new popular music appeal to you now, compared to five years ago? (Much less, Less, Same, More, Much more)

9. How strongly do you agree with: ‚ÄúAge influences my music preferences.‚Äù (5‚Äëpoint Likert: Strongly disagree ‚Üí Strongly agree)

1. Cross-sectional survey using stratified probability sampling. A two-stage sampling design was employed.

2. A field sample of approximatively 50,000 units was used. Among them, about 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to selected households across Canada. A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected.

3. The target population for the GSS Giving, volunteering and participating includes all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.

4. The survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address (or single telephone number in the case a link between a telephone number and an address could not be established). The sampling frame was used for the purpose of obtaining a better coverage of households with a telephone number.

5. Data are collected directly from survey respondents either through an electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing). No proxy reporting is allowed. 

6. Data collection for this reference period: 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28

7. The overall response rate is 41.9%.

8. WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons (non-institutionalized and aged 15 or over) having one or several given characteristics.

In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.

9. utomated and manual edit checks (e.g., consistency, flow, family relationship checks).
CATI system handled in-interview validation and routing.
Central office re-verified and corrected flagged issues.

10. Except in a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. Certain characteristics on each record with item or partial non response (also called a recipient record) were compared with the characteristics on all donor records. Imputation was carried out in nine steps. The first step consisted of imputing personal income and family income. The next three steps involved imputing the formal volunteering variables in the master file. Steps five and six were imputing the informal volunteering variables in the master file. Finally, the last three steps involved imputing variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file.

11. Nonsampling error: imperfect coverage and non-response

12. Excludes individuals in territories and institutions.
Households without telephone access not covered.
Mode effects: Differences may arise between CATI and online respondents.
Response bias: Volunteering and charitable behavior may be overreported due to social desirability.
Changes in questionnaire design or methodology may limit comparability with earlier cycles.
